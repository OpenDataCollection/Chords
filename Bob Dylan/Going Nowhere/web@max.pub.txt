capo 2

G                Am
Clouds so swift  Rain won't lift
C                 G
Gate won't close  Railings froze
G                 Am
Get your mind off wintertime
C                 G
You ain't goin' nowhere

chorus:
G        Am
Whoo-ee  Ride me high
  C                    G
Tomorrow's the day, My bride's gonna come
G           Am
Oh  oh  are we gonna fly
C                G
Down in the easy chair 

G                     Am
I don't care how many letters they sent
C                G
Morning came and morning went
G                      Am
Pick up your money And pack up your tent
C                 G
You ain't goin' nowhere

:chorus

G                    Am
Buy me a flute And a gun that shoots
C             G
Tailgates and substitutes
G                     Am
Strap yourself To the tree with roots
C                 G
You ain't goin' nowhere

:chorus

G               Am
Genghis Khan He could not keep
C                G
All his kings Supplied with sleep
G                        Am
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
C                 G
When we get up to it

:chorus
