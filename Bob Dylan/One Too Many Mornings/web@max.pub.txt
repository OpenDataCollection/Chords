C                             Am
Down the streets the dogs are barkin'
        F                C
And the day is a-gettin' dark
C                       Am
As the night comes in a-fallin
    F                  G
The dogs'll lose their bark
C                         Am
And the silent night will shatter
         F                C
From the sounds inside my mind
C                    Am
For I'm one too many mornings
      F        G     C
And a thousand miles behind

C                         Am
From the crossroads of my doorstep 
   F                  C
My eyes they start to fade 
                       Am
As I turn my head back to the room
         F               G
Where my love and I have laid 
      C                Am
An' I gaze back to the street 
    F                C
The sidewalk and the sign 
                     Am
And I'm one too many mornings
      F        G     C
An' a thousand miles behind 


       C               Am
It's a restless hungry feeling
           F              C
That don't mean no one no good 
          C           Am
When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
        F              G
You can say it just as good 
C                 Am
You're right from your side 
F              C
I'm right from mine 
                C            Am
We're both just one too many mornings
      F        G     C
An' a thousand miles behind
