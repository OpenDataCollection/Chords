C        F            C        Am    
How many roads must a man walk down, 
  C        F        G 
before you call him a man?
C        F           C          Am     
How many seas must a white dove sail, 
  C        F         G
before she sleeps in the sand?
C        F              C           Am    
How many times must the cannonballs fly, 
  C            F       G
before they're forever banned?

chorus:
    F         G          C              Am             
The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind.
    F         G              C
The answer is blowing in the wind.

E        F            C        Am
How many years must a mountain exist, 
  C          F             G   
before it is washed to the sea?
C        F              C      Am    
How many years can some people exist,
  C            F             G
before they're allowed to be free?
C        F           C            Am         
How many times can a man turn his head, 
    C               F           G     
and pretend that he just doesnt see?

:chorus

C        F            C        Am   
How many times must a man look up, 
  C           F       G 
before he can see the sky?
C        F         C       Am   
How many ears must one man have, 
  C           F           G 
before he can hear people cry?
C        F              C             Am   
How many deaths will it take 'till he knows, 
     C        F           G    
that too many people have died?
