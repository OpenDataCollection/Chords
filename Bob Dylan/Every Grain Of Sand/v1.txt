capo 1

       D             G               D                  G
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
         D               G             A           Asus4   A
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
          D               G     D                G
There's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere,
D              G                 A      Asus4 A
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
 
      A             A7             D              A
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
     A             A7                  D                | A     G |
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
 
[chorus]
       D           G            D                G
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand
   D               G            A     A7sus4  | D | % |
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
 
        D            G                D              G
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
     D                    G                    A          Asus4    A
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.
    D              G                D                 G
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
   D                G                A      Asus4 A
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
 
  A             A7             D              A
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
    A            A7               D              | A     G |
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
 
     D            G         D            G
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
     D             G             A     A7sus4   | D | % |
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.

       D                 G             D             G
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
       D             G                      A7         A7sus4 A7
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
       D               G          D           G
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
       D                G            A7       A7sus4 A7
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
 
  A                A7                 D             A
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
    A                     A7                   D             | A     G |
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
 
     D              G              D          G
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
     D             G             A     A7sus4  | D | % |
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
