Old man look at my life,
                   D
I'm a lot like you were.

D       F 
Old man look at my life,
C                       G 
Twenty-four and there's so much more
D               F 
Live alone in a paradise
     C                 F 
That makes me think of two.
 
D          F 
Love lost, such a cost,
C                   G 
Give me things that don't get lost.
D                C 
Like a coin that won't get tossed
F                       G 
Rolling home to you.
 
chorus: 
D
Old man take a look at my life
      Am  Em   G 
I'm a lot like you
D  
I need someone to love me
    Am    Em  G 
the whole day through
D  
Ah, one look in my eyes
            Am   Em     G 
and you can tell that's true.
 
 
D          F 
Lullabies, look in your eyes,
C              G 
Run around the same old town.
D                 F 
Doesn't mean that much to me
   C                 F 
To mean that much to you.
 
D         F 
I've been first and last
C               G 
Look at how the time goes past.
D            C 
But I'm all alone at last.
F                    G 
Rolling home to you.
