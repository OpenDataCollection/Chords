Em        C     D         G 
I want to live, I want to give
Em          C           D       G 
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
Em           C         D       G 
It's these expressions I never give

chorus
Em                           G 
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
C                     C  Am  G 
And I'm getting old
Em                      G 
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
C                     C  Am  G 
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

chorus

Em                      D        Em 
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Em                        D         Em 
You keep me searching and I'm growing old 
Em                      D           Em 
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Em                G 
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
