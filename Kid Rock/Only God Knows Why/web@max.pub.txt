
E      
I ve been sittin here 
                B
Tryin to find myself
               A
I get behind myself
                   E
I need to rewind myself
                 
Lookin for the payback
                  B 
Listen for the playback
               A                         E
They say that every man bleeds just like me
                   
And now I feel like number one
                B
Yet I m last in line
                    A
I watch my youngest son
                         E
And it helps to pass the time
                                           B
I take too many pills it helps to ease the pain
                      A                          E
I made a couple of dollar bills still I feel the same

Everybody knows my name
                    B
They say it way out loud
               A
A lot of folks fuck me
                         E
It s hard to hang out in crowds
        
I guess that s the price you pay
             D
To be some big shot like I am
A                 
Outskirt stands and one night stands
E                            C m
Still I can t find love
F m                                     C m
And when your walls come tumbling down
       F m        A        
I will always be around

SOLO: E  B  D  A  E  2x    C m
F m                                     C m
And when your walls come tumbling down
       F m        A
I will always be around
E                           B
People don t know about the things I say and do
           D    A                           E
They don t understand about the shit that I ve been through
                                  B            
It s been so long since I ve been home
          A                          E       
I ve been gone    I ve been gone for way too long
E                  B
Maybe I forgot all things I miss
              A                             E
Oh somehow I know there s more to life than this

I said it too many times
                  B
And I still stand firm
    A
You get what you put in
                         E
And people get what they deserve
 
Still I ain t seen mine
                D
No I ain t seen mine
          A
I ve been giving just ain t been gettin
                            E
I ve been walking down that line

So I think I ll keep on walking
        B 
With my head held high
          A                  E
I ll keep moving on and only God knows why
     E            B
Only God     only God
     A         E
Only God knows why
     E      D        A           E                   D A
Only God    knows    why why why only God knows why
               E               D A
Take me to the river s   edge
               E                     D  A
Take me to the river   hey hey hey
D  A  E
