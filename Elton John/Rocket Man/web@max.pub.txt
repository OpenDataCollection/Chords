capo 3

Em                                A
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Em              A
Zero hour, nine a.m.
C                G  quick C     D
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
Em                                  A
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
Em                    A
It's so lonely out in space
C         G   quick C   D
On such a timeless flight

Chorus: [x2]
G                                     C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                                          G
'Till touch down brings me round again to find
                                   C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           G              A
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
C                                         G
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone 
                                      (+Eb between choruses)


Em                              A
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
Em                   A
In fact it's cold as hell
C                  G  quick C         D
And there's no one there to raise them, if you did
Em                           A
And all this science I don't understand
Em                           A
It's just my job, five days a week
C        G quick C   D
A rocket man, a rocket man

Chorus [x2 again]
G                                      C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time [x4 sounds pretty good, end w/ Eb]
