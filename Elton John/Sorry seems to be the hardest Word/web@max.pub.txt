capo 3

Em                                Am        
What have I got to do to make you love me
D                                 G 
What have I got to do to make you care
Em                          Am        
What do I do when lightning strikes me
D                                  G 
And I wake to find that you're not there

Em                       Am        
What do I do to make you want me
D                           G 
What have I got to do to be heard
Em                          Am        
What do I say when it's all over
D                                 G 
And sorry seems to be the hardest word


C        B
It's sad, so sad
Em              A
It's a sad, sad situation
C                B               Em
And it's getting more and more absurd
C        B
It's sad, so sad
Em           A
Why can't we talk it over
C                  
Oh it seems to me
     Am             B              Em
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
