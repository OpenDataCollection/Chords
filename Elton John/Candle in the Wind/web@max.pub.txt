              E                    A 
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all
                     E                                    A
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled
                        E                          A            
They crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain
                   E                                       A
They sent you on a treadmill and they made you change your name


Chorus : 

       B                   
And it seems to me you lived your life
       E             A
Like a candle in the wind
      E                                B
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
      A                                          C#m
And I would have liked to've known you but I was just a kid
                       B                A           E
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
    

Other verses:

Loneliness was tough, the toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar and pain was the price you paid
And even when you died, oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean, from a young man in the twenty second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual, more than just our Marilyn Monroe
