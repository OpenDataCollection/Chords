Verse:
Em      D                 Em     C   C/B  Am
When I first set eyes on you
          Em          G                   D
First you beat me up, then you kissed me too
Em          D              Em      C   C/B  Am
We'd throw stone into the sea
               Em            G            D
There were no others there, just you and me
Em            D                 Em      C   C/B   Am
I crossed the bridge and down the lane
            Em           G                     D
I knew I loved you then, you said you did the same

I should've seen it coming, and to your side I'd run
C  G       C        G
Oh Maggie, come to me tonight
C     G                                 D
I will wait up for you, make sure you're alright

and you looked very thin

she couldn't speak for tears 
Em            D         Em      C   C/B  Am
she said you left me a note

inside my pocket burns

with these words you wrote

verse 5:
Em            D             Em     C   C/B  Am
i think you came the other night 
                Em  
you stroked my brow 
      G		       D
your eyes were full of light 
Em             D      Em      C   C/B  Am
may have only been a dream 
             Em   
but i would walk with you 
      G                 D
to places i never have been 
Em       D    Em    C   C/B   C   Em  G   D
maggie's gone
