[Verse]
G                                  C                G
They tell me little darlin' that tomorrow you'll be wed
                                           A7              D7
You thought that you would hurt me but you hurt yourself instead       
     G                               C                G
I'll always be the same old pal just as in years gone by    
     C                 G                   D7            G
I'll just set back and watch you while you sit alone and cry.
          
[Chorus]
G             C                G
Tears fallin' down your pretty cheeks
                           A7                D7
Tears you can not hide and tears you can not keep
G                            C          G
They are tears of sorrow and tears of delight
                                 D7                 G  
I Wish I Had A Nickel, for every tear you shed last night.

[Verse]
G                                    C             G
I just dropped by to tell you that I wish you happiness
                                    A7           D7
I hope that you'll forgive me for intruding like this
  G                                C                  G
I hope my dear your happiness will follow through the years
     C                 G                    D7                G
I'll just set back and watch you, while you shed those bitter tears.

[Chorus]
G             C                G
Tears fallin' down your pretty cheeks
                           A7                D7
Tears you can not hide and tears you can not keep
G                             C          G
There are tears of sorrow and tears of delight
                                 D7                 G  
I Wish I Had A Nickel, for every tear you shed last night.
