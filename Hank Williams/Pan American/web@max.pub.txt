[Intro]
E   B7   E

[Verse]
                           E7             A
I have heard your stories about your fast trains,
    B7                                                      E
But now I'll tell you about one all the southern folks have seen.
                                         E7              A
She's the beauty of the southland listen to that whistle scream,
B7                                         E
It's that Pan American on her way to New Orleans.

[Chorus]
                              E7              A
She leaves Cincinnati headin' down that Dixie line,
         B7                                                    E
When she passes that Nashville tower you can hear that whistle whine.
                                          E7                A
Stick your head right out the window and feel that southern breeze,
       B7                                     E
You're on that Pan American on her way to New Orleans.

[Verse]
                                    E7              A
If you're ever in the southland and want to see the scenes,
     B7                                         E
Just get yourself a ticket on the Pan American Queen.
                                              E7            A
There's Louisville, Nashville, Montgomery the capital of Alabam,
    B7                                                E
You pass right through them all when your New Orleans bound.

                              E7              A
She leaves Cincinnati headin' down that Dixie line,
         B7                                                    E
When she passes that Nashville tower you can hear that whistle whine.
                                          E7                A
Stick your head right out the window and feel that southern breeze,
       B7                                       E      B7  E
You're on that Pan American on her way to New Orleans.
