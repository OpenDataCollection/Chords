D                        G        D
I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
D                                 A
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
            G                 D
When I pass by all the people say
                          A        D
Just another boy down the lost highway


               D           G      D
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
                                     A
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
            G               D
For the day we met I went astray
                            A        D
I started rolling down that lost highway


D                G      D
I was just a lad nearly 22
                                     A
Neither good nor bad just a kid like you
            G                D
And now I'm lost too late to pray
                          A        D
Lord I take a cost oh the lost highway


                        G        D
Now boy's dont start to ramblin' round
                                   A
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
          G                        D
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
                              A        D
You started rollin' down that lost highway
