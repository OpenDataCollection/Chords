A                       D              A 
Just about a year ago  I set out on the road
                    F#m           D                   E
Seekin' my fame and fortune  And looking for a pot of gold
A               F#m                  D                 A
Things got bad,  Things got worse  I Guess you know the tune
         E              D          A      
Oh lord, stuck in Lodi again   


I rode in on a grey hound  I'll be walking out if I go
I was just passing through  Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money  Looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine  Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection  Ran out of songs to play
Came into town on a one night stand  Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar  For every song I sung
                G#m                 E                F# 
And everytime I had to play  While people sat there drunk
    B                  G#m          E               B
You know I'd catch the next train  Back to where I live
B        F#                E                 B     F#               E     B   
  Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again          Oh Lard, stuck in a Lodi again
