[Verse 1]
    Am       C        G           Am
The river is flowing, flowing and growing,
    Am        C      G           Am
the river is flowing back to the sea. 
Am             C                 G            Am
Mother Earth is carrying me, her child I will always be, 
Am              C            G           Am
Mother Earth is carrying me, back to the sea. 
 
[Verse 2]
The Moon she is waiting, waxing and waning
the Moon she is waiting, for us to be free.
Sister Moon watch over me, a child I will always be.
Sister Moon watch over me, until we are free.
 
[Verse 3]
The Sun he is shining, brightly heÂ´s shining,
the Sun he is shining, lightning the way.
Father Sun shine over me, your child I will always be,
father Sun shine over me, until we can see!
 
[Verse 4]
The Fire is burning, destroying and healing,
the Fire is burning, for us to get pure.
Violet Flame burn over me, a child I will always be,
violet Flame burn over me, until we are pure.
