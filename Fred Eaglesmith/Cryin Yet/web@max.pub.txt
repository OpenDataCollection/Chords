capo 2

      D
Yesterday I saw you
         A                Bm
You were out on the town again
    D
You had your back to me
         A                       Bm
You were talking to some of your friends
     G                               
They must have said something 'cause 
                              Bm
you turned and your face went red

chorus
     D                  A    
Oh I guess that I ain't done 
          Bm
my cryin' yet
      D                  A   
No, I guess that I ain't done
          Bm
my cryin' yet

The last time I talked to you 
You said that's the way things go
It rains when you need it 
and it pours when you don't
Then you finished your drink 
and you took my last cigarette

chorus

If I had me some money 
I'd buy me a ticket right now
I'd get me a truck and 
head on out of this town
If I had me the choice 
you'd be the one I'd forget

chorus

Out on the edge of town 
the circle is small
The talk is cheap and 
they take it right to the wall
And lately it's been 
your name written on it

chorus
