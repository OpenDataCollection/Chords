G
I come up from the bottom rung
Am                     C
I'd been hunting and I had my gun
G
Wind was still things were quiet
Am                         C     G
Called for Katie there was no reply

I checked the shed I checked the barn
I opened the door and there she was
In the arms of my friend Joe
And she wasn't wearing any clothes


G
Katie Katie what I'd do
Am          C    
I was so in love with you
G
Worked my fingers to the bone
Am                  C        G
I never even wanted this old farm

Joe tried to talk he just coughed
My heart stopped the gun went off
Katie screamed out his name
And then the gun went off again

Chorus

Wrapped them up in gunny sacks
I hitched a wagon threw them in the back
I buried that Joe down by the creek
I laid my Katie neath the hickory tree

Chorus

Now there's houses up all around this farm
Staring into new back yards
Every day they come by
But I won't sell and I won't say why
