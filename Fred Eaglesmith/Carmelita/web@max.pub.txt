D                              
Down along the railroad tracks 
Am
I ran into my old friend Jack.
C                     G                   
He was dressed in his Sunday best 
        D
but his face was red and his eyes were dead.

   D                             
He said, "I lost Marina, 
        Am
and the last place that I seen her,
C              G                
She was makin' off 
             D
with my best friend."

  D                     
I took him to the water.
Am 
I spent fifty dollars
   C                    G           
On something that would take him 
       D
to the moon.

        D                  
Well he must have gone to heaven 
       Am
'cause just before I left him,
  C                 G      
I tried to wake him up 
                D
but he wouldn't move.

chorus:
   D              
So come on, Carmelita, 
    Am
you drank too much and I can see that
C                 G   
Soon you're gonna need 
            D
a breath of air.

      D                           
We'll dance across the wheat field, 
          Am
there's a place I know just east of here
       C                 G        
And it wouldn't take too long 
           D
to go down there.

      Am
We'll sleep out on the ground
           C                                    G     D
And in the morning when we wake up, we'll leave town.

      D                           
And I picked my last tobacco leaf, 
Am
soaking wet up to my knees,
C                    G   
Out there before the sun 
           D
was on the rise.

            D                     
And you can have a drink of water, 
    Am
but don't you look at my daughter,
        C                   G   
Or I'll come down there and cut 
              D
you with this knife.

chorus

D                            
There ain't any flack man, 
    Am
but if you're a black man
        C            G          
They'll put you on a plane 
                     D
back to where you're from.
