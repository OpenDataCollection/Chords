G                              D
Stumbling past your house baby at the break of day
  Am                            C
I thought I saw your silhouette dancing cross the shade
G                                 D
And I went down to the mission, I called and called your name
        Am                                C 
Till an angel with a face like yours came down and let me in 

chorus:
          G                        D
Thought I saw your reflection in a cigarette machine
     Am                        C
In a bottle in the gutter In a window on the street
     G                             D
In a storefront in a picture on an old broken TV
  Am               C
I swear it was you staring back at me

G                        D
I heard soldier's voices by the city gate
           Am                                C
There were junkies lying on the ground, they made me look away
  G                          D
I spilled you in a mirror, I chopped you into lines
Am                            C
Over some old kitchen sing, I swore I'd let you die

:chorus

    G                          D
Old radios and broken mirrors, dog-eared things I read
Am                      C
Worn out movie stars in faded limousines
  G                                D
I stumble through my own charades, coffee cups and clowns
  Am                            C
I can't keep up with parades, I keep falling down

:chorus
