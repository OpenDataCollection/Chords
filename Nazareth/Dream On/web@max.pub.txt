      D
Dream on 
        G    D
You can hide away
            G         D
When theres nothing to say
      A
So Dream on 

      D
Draem on 
           G       D
Though its hard to tell
             G           D
Thought your foolin' yourself
      A
Dream on 

                              G   D   Dsus4 D Dsus2
 You can laugh at me cause I'm cry-ing
 A                                    G             D
 You can tell your friends how much I begged you to stay
 A                          G       D  Dsus4 D Dsus2
 You can have your fantasys without me
 A                                G      D
 But you'll never know how much I needed you

 Dream on 
 It's so easy for you
 Though I'm broken in two
 Dream on 

 Dream on 
 You can never see
 What your doing to me
 Dream on 

You can cross your heart and still be lyin
You can count the reasons why you've thrown it away
You can dream your life away without me
But you'll never know how much I've needed you

Guitar solo   later 

 All the   is sung after the guitar solo in that order 

The end  without music

Dream on 
Though its hard to tell
Though your foolin' yourself
Dream on

DREAM ON
