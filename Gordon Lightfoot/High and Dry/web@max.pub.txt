       E         E
 With a lady-like devotion
     E                E
 She sails the bitter ocean
       A                   A
 If it wasn't for lovesick sailors
            A                E
 There'd be nothin' left but flotsam


CHORUS capo 5
         B         A
 Singin' why me oh my
            E               A
 Is there a better man than I
            E                  B
 I hope you find your way back home
            E            A  
 Before you lie high and dry
            E                  B
 I hope you find your way back home
            E      B
 Before you die
 


CHORUS
         E         D
 Singin' why me oh my
            A               D
 Is there a better man than I
            A                  E
 I hope you find your way back home
            A            D  
 Before you lie high and dry
            A                  E
 I hope you find your way back home
            A      E
 Before you die
 


     A               A
 Her sails blow like bubbles
          A             A
 While ya sip yer daily doubles
        D                     D
 If she wasn't so fond of the weather
           D                  A
 She might give the deckhands trouble

:chorus


     A               A
 One day when I grew older
       A                 A
 And I found I could not hold her
     D                    D
 She took on a fine young skipper
          D               A
 Who soon run her up on a boulder


:chorus


VERSE 4
         A                A
 Now the pleasures of the harbor
       A              A
 Don't include a lady barber
       D                    D
 If it wasn't for Long John Silver
           D                     A
 All of us pirates would've been martyrs



:chorus
