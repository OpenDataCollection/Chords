capo 2

G                 
If you could read my mind love
F
What a tale my thoughts could tell
G                 
Just like an old time movie
F
'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
G                     C
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
     D              Em
With chains upon my feet
    C                  G
You know that ghost is me
    C            G
And I will never be set free
   Am            D                    G           
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

G               
If I could read your mind love
F   
What a tale your thoughts could tell
G                
Just like a paperback novel
F   
The kind that drugstores sell
G                                 C
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
    D             Em
The hero would be me
    C            G
But heroes often fail
    C                   G  
And you won't read that book again
  Am                 D                G
Because the ending's just too hard to take

G                    C
I'd walk away like a movie star
         D                     Em
Who gets burned in a three-way script
C            G
Enter number two
 
  C              G  
A movie queen to play the scene
   Am               D                  Em
Of bringing all the good things out in me
        C                  G
But for now love, let's be real
  C                     G  
I never thought I could feel this way 
         Am                D
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
C                  G  
I don't know where we went wrong
        Am                   D                 G
But the feeling's gone and I just canâ€™t get it back

G                 
If you could read my mind love
F   
What a tale my thoughts could tell
G                 
Just like an old time movie
F   
'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
G                     C
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
     D              Em
With chains upon my feet
    C              G
But stories always end
    C             G  
And if you read between the lines
       Am                 D              Em
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
    C                 G
The feelings that you lack
  C                     G  
I never thought I could feel this way
         Am                D
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
C                  G  
I don't know where we went wrong
        Am    
But the feeling's gone
      D                 G    
And I just can't get it back
