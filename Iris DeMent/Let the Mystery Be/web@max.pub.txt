capo 3

 
[D]Everybody is w[G]onderin' what and w[A]here they all came f[D]rom
Everybody is w[G]orryin' 'bout where they're gonna [A]go
When the whole thing's d[D]one
But no one knows for c[G]ertain, and so it's a[D]ll the same to [G]me
[D]I think I'll just [A] let the mystery [D] be.
 
Some say once gone you're g[G]one forever
And s[A]ome say say you're gonna come b[D]ack
Some s[D]ay you rest in the a[G]rms of the Saviour
If in s[A]inful ways you l[D]ack
Some s[D]ay that they're comin' b[G]ack in a garden
Bunch of c[D]arrots and little sweet p[G]eas
[D]I think I'll just [A] let the mystery [D] be.

Some s[D]ay they're goin' to a p[G]lace called Glory
And I a[A]in't sayin' it ain't a f[D]act
But I've h[D]eard that I'm on the r[G]oad to purgatory
And I d[A]on't like the sound of t[D]hat
[D] I believe in l[G]ove and I live my l[D]ife according[G]ly
[D] But I choose [A] to let the mystery [D] be.
