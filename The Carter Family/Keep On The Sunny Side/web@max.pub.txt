capo 2

          A          D                A
There's a dark and a troubled side of life,

there's a bright and a sunny side, [E]too.

Though we meet with the [E7]darkness and [A]strife,

the [E]sunny side we [E7]also may [A]view.

CH

[A]Keep on the sunny side, [D]always on the [A]sunny side,

keep on the sunny side of [E]life !

It will [A]help us every day, it will [D]brighten all our [A]way,

if we keep on the [E]sunny side of [A]life.

 

Oh, the storm and its fury break today,

crushing hopes that we cherish so dear.

The clouds and storm will in time pass away,

the sun again will shine bright and clear.       + CHORUS

 

Let us greet with a song of hope each day,

though the moment be cloudy or fair,

let us trust in our Savoir always,

to keep us every one in His care.        + CHORUS
