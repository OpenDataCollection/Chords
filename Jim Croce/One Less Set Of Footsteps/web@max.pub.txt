 C                  F           G 
We're been runnin' away from, 
 C                 F        G 
Somethin' we both know, 
      C        E7     F         C 
We've long run out of things to say,
       F        C      Bb     G 
And I think I'd better go. 
 C                     F      G 
So don't be gettin' excited, 
         C         Em        Am    D7 
When you hear that slammin' door, 
                    C               G 
'Cause there'll be one less set of footsteps
	   F 		    C 
On your floor in the mornin'.


 C                          F           G 
And we've been hidin' from somethin',
                  C               F        G 
That should have never gone this far,
 C         E7       F          C 
But after all it's what we've done,
      F        C      Bb     G 
That makes us what we are.
 C                          F      G 
And you've been talkin' in silence, 
              C       Em   Am    D7 
Well if it's silence you adore, 
                 C               G 
Oh, there'll be one Less set of footsteps
	   F 		    C 
On your floor in the mornin'.


Chorus:
                  F                                 C 
Well there'll be one Less set of footsteps on your floor,
 F        Am     C  
One Less man to walk in,
 F                                G  
One Less pair of jeans upon your door,
 Am       D       G7 
One less voice a-talkin'.


 C                F           G 
But tomorrow's a dream away, 
       C                 F           G 
And today has turned to dust,
 C           E7         F         C 
Your silver tongue has turned to clay,
          F      C       Bb    G 
And your golden rule to rust. 
 C                          F           G 
If that's the way that you want it,
                 C     Em      Am    D7 
Well that's the way I want it more, 
                    C               G 
'Cause there'll be one less set of footsteps
	   F            C 
On your floor in the mornin'.


               F                           C  
Well there'll be one Less set of footsteps on your floor,
 F        Am     C  
One Less man to walk in,
 F                                G  
One Less pair of jeans upon your door,
 Am       D       G7 
One less voice a-talkin'.



 C                F           G 
But tomorrow's a dream away, 
       C                 F           G 
And today has turned to dust,
 C           E7         F         C 
Your silver tongue has turned to clay,
          F      C       Bb    G 
And your golden rule to rust. 
 C                          F           G 
If that's the way that you want it,
                 C     Em      Am    D7 
Well that's the way I want it more, 
                    C               G 
'Cause there'll be one less set of footsteps
	   F            C 
On your floor in the mornin'.
