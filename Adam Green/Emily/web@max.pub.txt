D                           G  
I just don't care about the evening news
D                     A
I never listen to the crackhouse blues
D                        G
They say the city is the place to be
D       A          D
I wanna dance with Emily

D                         G
Everybody come around the window shop
D                           A
I guess they never seen the moves I got
D                        G
I wanna be with what the people see
D       A          D
I wanna dance with Emily

G
Emily, sweet baby, won't you be my wife
D
Cutting me wide open with a kitchen knife
A7
Everybody said that she is underage
E
Honky tried to shoot me with a 7 gage

D                               G
Now I got the cookies that your momma sent
D                         A
I got permission from the government
D                             G
Someone should mention to the minister
D           A          D
Now I gotta dance with Jennifer

D                               G
Jenny's got a mousehole full of pigeon scum
D                         A
On top a mountain made of bubble gum
D                             G
Don't understand what all the grief is for
D           A          D
Now I gotta dance with Eleanor

G
Eleanor, I wonder if we move too slow
D
Straight down the hatch beneath the streetlight's glow
A7
Baby when I get you on that persian rug
E
That's the kind of movies I've been dreaming of

D                                  G
I'll tell you something that you'd think I know
D                        A  
I got two tickets to the sold out show
D                          G
Some of the fellas like to think I'm Greek
D       A              D
I wanna love you maybe three days a week


D                           G
I just don't care about the evening news
D                     A
I never listen to the crackhouse blues
D                        G
I wanna be with what the people see
D       A          D
I wanna dance with Emily

I wanna dance with Emily
