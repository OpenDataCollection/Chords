[Verse 1]
Am               C
Jimmy, won't you please come home
          G                      F
Where the grass is green and the buffaloes roam
Am                   C                   G
Come see Jimmy, your uncle Jim, and your auntie Jim and
     F
your cousin Jim
Am                         C
Come home Jimmy 'cause you need a bath
         G                F
And your grandpa Jimmy is still gone daft

[Verse 2]
            Am              C
Now there's buffalo Jim and buffalo Jim
    G                    F
And Jim buffalo, now now didn't you know 
Am                         C
Jim Jimmy Jimmy, it's your last cigarette
            G                     F
But there's buffalo piss and it's all kind of wet
Am                       C
Jambo Jimmy you'd better hold your nose
    G                           F
All roads lead to roam with the buffaloes

[Chorus]
        Am                F      G             Am
And the Buffaloes used to say be proud of your name
    Am                F   G           Am
The Buffaloes used to say be what you are
    Am                F   G              Am
The Buffaloes used to say roam where you roam
    Am                F   G           Am
The Buffaloes used to say do what you do

[Verse 3]
         Am                        C
Hey, you gotta have a wash but you can't clean your name
       G                           F
You're now called Jimmy, you'll be Jimmy just the same
    Am                       C
The keys are in the bag in a chest by the door
    G                          F
And one of Jimmy's friends has taken the floor
 
Am               C
Jimmy, won't you please come home
          G                      F
Where the grass is green and the buffaloes roam
Am              C
Dear old Jimmy, forgot you're young
        G                F
But you can't ignore the buffalo song
