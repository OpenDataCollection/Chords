From a phone booth in Vegas Jessie calls at five a.m. 
                      Am     C            G
To tell me that she's tired     of all of them
                         Am               C              G
She says 'Baby I've been thinking about a trailer by the sea
             Am      C                 D
We can go to Mexico: you, the cat, and me
           Em     D              C
We drink tequila    and look for seashells
    Em      D          C
Now doesn't that sound sweet?  
Em          D      C
Jessie, you always do this
                           D     C    D    C    D
Every time I get back on my feet  

CHORUS:
G                  C               G              C
Jessie, paint your pictures, about how it's gonna be
G                 C            D                Em      D
By now I should know better, your dreams are never free
    G            C               G              C
But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea
G              C           D            Em     D
Jessie you can always sell any dream to me  
G              C           D            G
Jessie you can always sell any dream to me

She asks me how the cat's been, I say Moses, he's just fine
                   Am       C         G
He used to think about you    all the time
   G                 Am       C             G  
We finally took your pictures down from the wall
                  Am             C         D
Jessie how do you always seem to know just when to call?
        Em         D       C
She says: get your stuff together
      Em         D         C
Bring Mose' and drive real fast
    Em        D      C
And listening to her promise
                                     D    C    D    C    D
I swear to God this time it's gonna last

BRIDGE:
  Em       D      C
I love you in the sunshine
        Em          D          C
Lay you down in the warm white sand
    Em        D     C
And who knows maybe this time
                                     D       C   D  C  D
Things may turn out just the way you planned
