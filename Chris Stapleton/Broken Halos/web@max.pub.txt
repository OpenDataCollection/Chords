CAPO 1 

[Intro]
G               Cadd9    G       Em7
Seen my share of broken halos
       G         Cadd9      G
Folded wings that used to fly
                Cadd9     G       Em7
They've all gone wherever they go
      G          Cadd9     G     Em7  G Cadd9 G
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse]
G               Cadd9     G       Em7
Angels come down from the heavens
        G       Cadd9   G
Just to help us on our way
               Cadd9    G            Em7
Come to teach us, then they leave us
           G             Cadd9     G
And they find some other soul to save

[Chorus]
G                Cadd9     G     Em7
Seen my share of broken halos
       G         Cadd9      G
Folded wings that used to fly
                Cadd9     G       Em7
They've all gone wherever they go
       G          Cadd9    G     Em7
Broken halos that used to shine
       G          Cadd9    G        Bm G Bm C  G
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 2]
G                Cadd9    G       Em7
Don't go looking for the reasons
      G         Cadd9  G
Don't go asking Jesus why
                  Cadd9     G        Em7
We're not meant to know the answers
      G            Cadd9  G   Em7
They belong to the by and by
      G            Cadd9  G 
They belong to the by and by

[Outro]
G                Cadd9   G   Em7
Seen my share of broken halos
       G          Cadd9     G
Folded wings that used to fly
                 Cadd9    G        Em7
They've all gone wherever they go
        G         Cadd9    G     Em7
Broken halos that used to shine
        G         Cadd9    G    Em7
Broken halos that used to shine
        G         Cadd9    G   
Broken halos that used to shine
        G         Cadd9    G
Broken halos that used to shine
