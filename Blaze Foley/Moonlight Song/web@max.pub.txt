C                       F               C
Moonlight shining through the trees
F                                           
Moonlight shining down on me
C                                        G
Lights the way for lovers in the dark
C                             F                 C         
Moonbeams dance on rain drenched trees
F
Sparkle for our eyes to see
C                        G                        C
Moonlight shine on down and shine on me

Moonlight bathes the world around
Paradise that we have found
Here among the trees and things we love
Shines on friends. All far away
Takes us to another day
Moonlight shine on down and shine on me

Layin with the one I love
Lookin at the moon above
Being where we really wanna be
The autumn winds for now are still
The moon turns on and always will
Moonlight shine on down and shine on me
Moonlight shine on down and shine on me
