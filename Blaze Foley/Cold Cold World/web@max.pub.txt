     E                           A             E
I've tried for a long time but I think I can't win
                                        B
I'd do it all better if I could do it a-gain
    E                       A            E
Wherever I'm going it's the same place I been
  	   B 	      E
Ain't it a cold, cold world

   E                   A           E
Outside it was hot but inside I am cold
                                          B
The eyes of the young met the eyes of the old 	 
     E                           A        E
And what they were thinking I'll never be told
  	   B 	      E
Ain't it a cold, cold world

        E                           A            E
Then an old lady asked me bout this new daylight time
                                            B
I said it don't matter and she said I don't mind
         E                         A        E
Then the bus driver said you still owe me a dime
  	   B 	      E
Ain't it a cold, cold world

  E                      A            E
I can't get no job and I can't get no rest 	  	 
                                  B
I started out east and I ended up west 
        E                      A             E
And I'm so glad to be here I'm sure, I would guess 
  	   B 	      E
Ain't it a cold, cold world

  E                          A                E
I might have to leave you, I think's what she said
                                        B
Wish I could sleep 'stead of tossing in bed
      E                           A          E
And I find myself thinking I'd be better off dead
  	   B 	      E
Ain't it a cold, cold world
