C                          F             C
It was June or September I don't rightly remember
                 G7           C
The first time I laid eyes on you
                         F          C
It was June or September Seattle or Denver
                 G7           C
The first time I laid eyes on you               

                                       F             C
You wore black sliver stockings with a seam down the back
               G7            C
Your dress was split to your thighs   
                                F         C
And your hair was a place for a dozen red roses
         G7             C
After it smothered your side

                                F         C
And you dealt in the card games in smokey saloons   
            G7          C
Haunted you saw the sun rise
                             F              C
But as soon as I leave you I looked to your photograph
                G7            C
Teardrops would swell in your eyes

                                     F               C
There were three tiny daughters that lived with your mother
         G7           C
You only wanted their best 
                                F               C
But you could not give them the things that you wanted to
         G7           C
You only wanted their best
