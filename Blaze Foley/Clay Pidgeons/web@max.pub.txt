          E
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, 
            A
gonna buy a ticket to ride
      E  
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids 
        B
and sit down by her side

              E                               
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 
      A
'bout two or three times
        E
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
        B  
Sing my song for the people I meet

         E
And get along with it all
          A
where the people say "y'all"
       E
Sing a song with a friend
           B
Change the shape that I'm in,

        E
And get back in the game,
          A                   E  B  E
And start playin' again


            E     
I'd like to stay but I might have to go 
         A
to start over again
         E                  
Might go back down to Texas, 
                           B
might go to somewhere that Ive never been

        E
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
            A
And I won't have to go home
           E
Get used to bein' alone
           B
Change the words to this song

       E            A   E  B G
Start singin' again



            E                                
Im tired of runnin round lookin for answers 
                    A
to questions that I already know
        E                                           
I could build me a castle of memories 
             B
just to have somewhere to go

          E                                                    
Count the days and the nights that it takes to get back 
       A
in the saddle again
         E
Feed the pigeons some clay
         B
Turn the night into day

      E                     
Start talkin' again, 
       A
when I know what to say



          E
