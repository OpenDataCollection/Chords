E          A                 
I like the way your sparkling
E        A
earrings lay
E            A       B      
against your skin so brown

    E         A              
and i want to sleep with you 
       E        A
in the desert tonight
E              A          B
with a billion stars all around 

chorus:
             A               E
'cos i got a peacefull  easy feeling
A                          B
and i know you wont let me down
         E F#m   A
cos' i'm already standing
       B7     E
on the ground

i found out 
a long time ago
what a woman can do to your soul
ah but she can't take you 
any way
you don't already know how to go 

chorus

i got this feeling 
i may know you
as a lover and a friend
but this voice keeps whispering 
in my other ear
tells me i may never see you agaim
