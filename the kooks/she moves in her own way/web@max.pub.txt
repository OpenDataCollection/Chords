E   E A6  x2


E                   A6                F#m
 So at my show on Monday I was hoping someday
                 G#m     A6*    E
You'd be on your way to better things
                    A6                        F#m
It's not about your make up or how you try to shape up
          G#m       A6*  E      A6 
To these tiresome paper dreams.    
F#m                 G#m A6*
Paper dreams honey.

 
E                     A6                               F#m
 So now you pour your heart out you're telling me your far out
             G#m        A6*       E
Not about to lie down for your cause
              A6
But you don't pull my strings
          F#m          G#m           A6*   E*
Cos I'm a better man moving on to better things.


        B             F#m
 But oh-oh, oh I love her because 
    A        B       C#m
She moves in her own way
       A               F#m
But oh-oh, oh she came to my show
        A     B       E*
Just to hear about my day.

E                   A6                     F#m
 And at the show on Tuesday she was in her mindset
          G#m        A6*     E
Tempered furs and spangled boots
             A6                 F#m
Looks are deceiving making me believe it
          G#m        A6*   E      A6 
And these tiresome paper dreams
   F#m                 G#m A6*
Paper dreams honey.



E              A6                       F#m
 So won't you go far tell me you're a keeper
             G#m       A6*       E
Not about to lie down for your cause
              A6
But you don't pull my strings
          F#m          G#m           A6*      E*
Cos I'm a better man moving on to better things.


        B             F#m
 But oh-oh, oh I love her because 
    A        B       C#m
She moves in her own way
       A               F#m
But oh-oh, oh she came to my show
        A     B       E*
Just to hear about my day.

Yes I wish that we never made it 
E              E/D#    C#m
Through all the summers
C#m           B                      G#m          
We kept them up instead of kicking us

Back down to the suburbs
