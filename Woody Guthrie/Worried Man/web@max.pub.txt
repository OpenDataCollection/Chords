capo 2

   G
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
   C                                     G
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
            D                           G
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

  G
I went across the river and I lay down to sleep
  C                                       G             
I went across the river and I lay down to sleep
            D                             G           
When I woke up, I had the shackles and my feet

G
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
C                                    G
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
            D                         G
And on each link is the initial of my name

chorus

  G
I asked the judge, what might be my fine
  C                                 G
I asked the judge, what might be my fine
           D                            G
Twenty-one years on that Rocky Mountain Line

    G
The train that I ride, is sixteen coaches long
    C                                      G
The train that I ride, is  sixteen coaches long
           D                         G
The girl I love is on that train and gone
