Theres more pretty girls than one
F                      C
More pretty girls than one
F            C
Every town I rambled around
G                      C
More pretty girls than one

Look down that railroad line
F                    C
See the train rolled by
F                     C
Train rolls by with a woman I love
      G                C
And I hung my head and cried

Theres more pretty girls than one
F                      C

Every town I rambled around

More pretty girls than one

Look out across that sea
F                C
See the breakers swell
    F              C
How many a love is washed away
   G                C
No human tongue can tell


C                             C7
Theres more pretty girls than one
F                      C
More pretty girls than one

Every town I rambled around
G                      C
More pretty girls than one
