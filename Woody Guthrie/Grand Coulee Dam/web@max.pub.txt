          G                                C
Well, the world has seven wonders that the travelers always tell,
     D                                              G 
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well,
    G                             C
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land
         D                                           G
It's the big Columbia River and the big Grand Coulee Dam.
  

          G                                 C
She heads up the Canadian Rockies where the rippling waters glide,
        D                                         G
Comes a-roaring down the canyon to meet the salty tide,
       G                            C
Of the wide Pacific Ocean where the sun sets in the West
        D                                               G
And the big Grand Coulee country in the land I love the best.


       G                             C
In the misty crystal glitter of that wild and wind ward spray,
         D                                           G
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave,
          G                                     C
Well, she tore their boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream
        D                                                  G
Of the day the Coulee Dam would cross that wild and wasted stream.


      G                                C
Uncle Sam took up the challenge in the year of 'thirty-three,
        D                                         G
For the farmer and the factory and all of you and me,
          G                             C
He said, "Roll along, Columbia, you can ramble to the sea,
    D                                                      G
But river, while you're rambling, you can do some work for me."


       G                             C
Now in Washington and Oregon you can hear the factories hum,
       D                                          G
Making chrome and making manganese and light aluminum,
    G                                      C
And there roars the flying fortress now to fight for Uncle Sam,
         D                                             G
Spawned upon the King Columbia by the big Grand Coulee Dam.
