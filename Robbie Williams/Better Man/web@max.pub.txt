                G
Send someone to love me
          Em
I need to rest in arms
        C
Keep me safe from harm
           D
In pouring rain

                G
Give me endless summer
        Em
Lord I fear the cold
           C
Feel I'm getting old
          D
Before my time

Em                    D
As my soul heals the shame
       G                 Em
I will grow through this pain
          C          D
Lord I'm doing all I can
                 G
To be a better man

                G
Go easy on my conscience
           Em
'Cause it's not my fault
            C
I know I've been taught
             D
To take the blame


Rest assured my angels
Will catch my tears
Walk me out of here
I'm in pain

Em                     D
As my soul heals the shame
        G                Em
I will grow through this pain
          C          D
Lord I'm doing all I can
               G
To be a better man


Once you've found that lover
You're homeward bound
Love is all around
Love is all around


I know some have fallen
On stony ground
But Love is all around

                G
Send someone to love me
          Em
I need to rest in arms
         C
Keep me safe from harm
            D
In pouring rain

                 G
Give me endless summer
       Em
Lord I fear the cold
          C
Feel I'm getting old
          D
Before my time

Em                     D
As my soul heals the shame
        G                Em
I will grow through this pain
         C           D
Lord I'm doin' all I can
                 G
To be a better man...
