C                 F       C
The name she gave was Caroline
F                 C
The daughter of a miner
        F
And her ways were free 
       Em        Am
And it seemed to me 
         G                 F        C
That the sunshine walked beside her

She came from Spencer, 'cross the hill.   
She said her pa had sent her, 
'Cause the coal was low, and soon the snow  
would turn the skies to winter.  

She said she'd come to look for work;  
She was not asking favors. 
For a dime a day and a place to stay 
she'd turn those hands to labor.  

But times were hard, and jobs were few  
all through Tecumseh valley, 
But she asked around and a job she found  
tending bar at Gypsy Sally's.  

She saved enough to get back home  
when spring replaced the winter, 
But her dreams were denied; her pa had died. 
The word come down from Spencer.  

Well she took to walking out in the streets 
With all the grief inside her 
And it was many a man 
Who returned again 
To walk that road beside her. 

So she turned to whorin' out on the streets,  
with all the lust inside her,  
And it was many a man returned again  
to lay himself beside her.  

They found her down beneath the stairs  
that led to Gypsy Sally's. 
In her hand when she died was a note that cried, 
"Fare thee well, Tecumseh Valley." 

<b>instrumental: verse</b> 

The name she gave was Caroline,   
daughter of a miner. 
Her ways were free, and it seemed to me 
The sunshine walked beside her.
