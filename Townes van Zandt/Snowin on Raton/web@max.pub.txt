    E(C)          B7(G7)            E(C)
Well when the wind don't blow in Amarillo,
        B7(G7)                      E(C)
And the moon along the Gunnison don't rise,
         A(F)                       E(C)
Shall I cast my dreams upon your love babe,
       B7(G7)           A(F)       E(C)
And lie beneath the laughter of your eyes.

CHORUS:
      E(C)   A(F) E(C)       B7(G7) 
It's snowin' on Raton, come morning,
         A(F)                  E(C)
I'll be through them hills and gone.


Oh Mother thinks the road is long and lonely,
Little brother thinks the road is straight and fine,
Well little darling thinks the road is soft and lovely,
I'm thankful that old road's a friend of mine.

CHORUS

Ah, bid the years good-bye, you cannot still them,
Well you cannot turn the circles of the sun,
Well you cannot count the miles until you feel them, 
And you cannot hold a lover that is gone.

CHORUS

Well, tomorrow the mountains will be sleeping 
Silent beneath a blanket green and blue
Ah but I shall hear the silence they are keeping
I'll bring all their promises to you.
