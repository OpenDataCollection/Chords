D
Well, I'm standin' with my head bowed down, now
           A                 D
That ain't right, that ain't wrong
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it
                A                       D
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long

If I hurt you, I did not mean to
I beg you pardon, I did not want to
When I leave you, don't you think about me?
Well, I won't be back babe, I'll be long gone

When the time comes and I'm not ready
Seems it's over before I'm started
Well, the time comes and I don't feel it
I don't know nothin' but my own

So I'm standin' with my head bowed down, now
And that ain't right, that ain't wrong
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long

Our kingdoms into the sky go
And the highway like a river does flow
On my way sometimes it hurts so
On your way, just don't go home

So I'm standin' with my head bowed down now
That ain't right, that ain't wrong
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long

Well, I'm standin' with my head bowed down now
That ain't right, that ain't wrong
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long

Well, I'm standin' with my head bowed down now
That ain't right, that ain't wrong
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it
Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long
