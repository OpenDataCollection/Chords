[Intro]

C Em F G C

 

 

[Verse 1]

C            Em7     F         C

Her face was crystal, fair and fine

F                   Em     Am                 G G7

And her breath was morning, and her lips were wine

F                 C        Am               F

And her eyes were laughter, and her touch divine

G                        F            C

And her face was crystal, and she was mine

 

[Interlude]

C Em F G C

 

 

[Verse 2]

C       Em7 F             C

If only she could feel my pain

F                Em    Am         G G7

But feelin' is a burden she can't sustain

F                C       Am         F

So like a summer Thursday I cry for rain

G                              F       C

To come and turn the ground to green again

[Verse 3]

C       Em7 F             C

If only she could hear my songs

F               Em                     Am        G G7

'Bout the empty difference 'tween the rights and wrongs

F                C Am          F

Then I know that I could stand alone

G               F               C

As well as they, now that she's gone

 

 

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]

C             Em7    F         C

Her face was crystal, fair and fine

F                  Em      Am                 G G7

And her breath was morning, and her lips were wine

F                 C       Am                F

And her eyes were laughter, and her touch divine

G                        F            C

And her face was crystal, and she was mine
