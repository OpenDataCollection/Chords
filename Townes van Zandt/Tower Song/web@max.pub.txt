capo 4

C  Em               Dm      F G7
So close and yet so far away
G7                     F       C
And all the things I'd hope to say
F               Em     Am
Will have to go unsaid today
F               G7
Perhaps until tomorrow
C    Em                 Dm          F  G7
Your fears have built a wall between
G7                     F      C
Our lives and all that loving means
F                 Em      Am
Will have to go unfelt it seems
F            G
Leaving only sorrow

chorus
F                    G          Em
You built your tower strong and tall
F                  G           C
Can't you see it's got to fall someday


You close your eyes and speak to me
Of faith and love and destiny
As distant as eternity
From truth and understanding
The wind blows cold outside your door
It whispers words I've tried before
But you don't hear me anymore
You're pride's just too demanding

chorus

The end is coming soon it's plain
A warm bed just ain't worth the pain
And I will go and you'll remain
With bitterness we've tasted
A mother's breast a new born child
A poet's tears a drunken smile
I can't help thinking all the while
Their meaning won't be wasted

chorus
