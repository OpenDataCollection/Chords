C                            Em
Well the drunken clown still hanging 'round
         F         Em        Dm
but it's plain the laughters all died down
G                      F                C
The tears you tried so hard to hide are flowing
C                        Em
And a blind man with his knife in hand
    F            Em                  Dm
has convinced himself that he understands
G
I wish him well, miss Carousel,
    F            C
but I gotta be a going

Am                 Em
Won't you come and get me when
Am                 Em
You're sure that you don't need me then
Am                 Em
I'll stand outside your window
    F                 Em    G
and proudly call your name      

Well the lady's been told that all her gold
is worth so much she can't be sold
No time to weep, she'll later sleep tomorrow
When she carries her face to the market place
and bets it on the open enrage
She can ring her bells, miss Carousel,
 but this singing brings me sorrow

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
and proudly call your name

But it's always done, every mothers sun
is surely grown, and never run
So they fight with all their might inside them
When the battles been fought 'n they all been taught
that the trick is just not being caught
Will you give 'em hell, miss Carousel,
 when they're begging you to hide them

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
and proudly call your name

When they need a rose, your eyes felt closed
You clamped your fingers around your nose
Would you say, that's anyway to judge him
Well you haven't got the authority
too kill him in the first degree
But would you feel compelled, miss Carousel,
if you had something to regret in

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
and proudly call your name

On velvet beach far beneath the reach
of those who come to pray and preach
The natural man that tried to stand is falling
Well how long will it be before he sees
you own his legs but his mind is free
only you can tell , miss Carousel,
how long will he be crawling

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
and proudly call your name

All the castle walls grown so tall
Seems there ain't no hope at all
to reach the top even though you stopped for breathing
But I ain't gonna try to make you cry
the teardrops couldn't find your eyes
It's all been swell, miss Carousel,
but the time has come for leaving

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then    <-(x4)
I'll stand outside your window
and proudly call your name
