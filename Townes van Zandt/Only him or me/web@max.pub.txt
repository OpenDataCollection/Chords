E	             B
Don't go saying I'm leaving you
A                                       E
Thinking I never got close enough to stay
E                  B
Time runs in, and then runs out
A                                        E
Starts again and it's always been that way
B
You're gonna drown tomorrow
        E            A                E
If you 	cry too many tears for yesterday
E                   B
Tomorrow's half of all you've got
A                                                E	
So treat him good, 'cause when I'm gone, he'll stay

I won't be forgetting you
And you won't be forgetting me, I know
If memory comes a summer cloud
Rains a sweetness down to me below
I see you like you look right now
Maybe wonder why I had to go
But heaven is the way she is
Rain falls and rivers flow

So here's to feelin' good
And here's to feelin' bad
Here's to bein' thankful
I'm sorry for the pleasures that we had
Autumn days and window panes
God forgive us if you feel deceived
But the clock don't know you like I do
It's only him or me you've got to believe
