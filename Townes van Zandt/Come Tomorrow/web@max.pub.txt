C               Dm       G          
Could it be the season's changin'  
F
the winds of winter rearranging 
C                   F                 G
All the leaves like fallin' queens of sorrow 
F                                     
Could be the freezing rain a-fallin'  
C               F
could be sad September callin' 
C            F                   C      
Or maybe its knowin' - she'll be gone
F    C
Come tomorrow

C                           Dm       G 
Well  it's strange how many tortured mornings  
F
fell upon us with no warning 
C             F                G
Lookin' for a smile to beg and borrow 
F 
It's over now  there is no returning  
C                  F
a thousand bridges sadly burning  
C             F                    C 
And light the way I have to walk - alone
F    C
Come tomorrow

C               Dm        G 
I guess that no amount of lying  
F
to myself will stop the crying 
C                 F                     G
I guess I have to take things like they are 
F             
The facts are plain to see it's only  
C                    F
that I ain't used to being lonely 
C              F            C  
Like I'm gonna be - without you
F    C
Come tomorrow 
F    C
Come tomorrow
