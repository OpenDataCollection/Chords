G           D
Won't say I love you babe
G           D
Won't say I need you babe
D                A
But I'm going to get you babe
      G               D
and I will not do you wrong

G               D
Living's mostly wasting time
G              D
and I waste my share of mine
D            A
but it never feels too good
   G                  D
so let's not take too long

       G       D               G      A
You're soft as glass and I'm a gentle man
D                 A
we got the sky to talk about
        G            D
and the world to lie upon

G           D
Days up and down they come
G              D
like rain on a conga drum
D            A
forget most, remember some
G                    D
but don't turn none away.

G             D
Everything is not enough
G              D
nothing is too much to bear
D                 A
where you been is good and gone
        G                  D
all you keep's the getting there.

   G          D         G       A
To live is to fly, both low and high
   D              A
so shake the dust off of your wings
        G                 D
and the sleep out of your eyes.

It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think of all the poetry
and the pickin' down the line.

I'll miss the system here
the bottom's low and the treble's clear
but it don't pay to think too much
on the things you leave behind.

I may be gone but I won't be long
I'll be bringing back the melody
and the rhythm that I find.

We all got holes to fill
and them holes are all that's real
some fall on you like a storm
sometimes you dig your own

But choice is yours to make
time is yours to take
some dive into the sea
some toil upon the stone.

   G          D         G       A
To live is to fly, both low and high
   D              A
so shake the dust off of your wings
        G                 D
and the sleep out of your eyes.
