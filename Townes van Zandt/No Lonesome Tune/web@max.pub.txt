capo 2


              C
I ain't gonna sing no lonesome tune

Aw, babe I'm a comin' soon
     G
I cannot b'leive I stayed so long away
      C
But a man must look around

And you're the sweetest thing I've found
         G                               C
Aw, your lost high roller's rolling home today


Well my daddy said to me
Son, it's hard as you will see
To find someone upon whom to rely
In the kitchen momma sneezed
Daddy grinned big as you please
Said "bless you" and a tear came to his eye

(guitar for one verse)

I did decide that very day
That I would like to live that way
And now I know I've just been wasting time
It's with you that I should be
And if you feel the same 'bout me
I'm headed home along the straightest line

I ain't gonna sing no lonesome tune
Aw, babe I'm a comin' soon
I cannot b'leive I stayed so long away
But a man must look around
And you're the sweetest thing I've found
Aw, your lost high roller's rolling home today
