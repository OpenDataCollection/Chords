C                              
Living on the road my friend  
G  
Is gonna keep you free and clean  
F                    
Now you wear your skin like iron  
C                      G  
Your breath as hard as kerosene  
F                                           
Weren't your mama's only boy  
        C               F  
But her favorite one it seems  
    Am                    F        G  
She began to cry when you said goodbye  
    F              Am        
And sank into your dreams  

C                          
Pancho was a bandit boys   
G  
his horse fast as polished steel  
F  
He wore his gun outside his pants  
C                  G  
For all the honest world to feel  
F                          
But Pancho met his match you know   
       C               F  
on the deserts down in Mexico  
Am               F     G     
Nobody heard his dying words   
       F                 Am  
ah but that's the way it goes  

chorus:
F                       
All the Federales say   
C                       F  
they could have had him any day  
Am                F     G  
They only let him slip away   
       F             Am  
out of kindness I suppose

C  
Lefty he can't sing the blues   
G  
all night long like he used to  
F                       
The dust that Pancho bit down south   
C           G  
ended up in Lefty's mouth  
F                                
When they laid poor Pancho low   
C               F  
Lefty split for Ohio  
Am               F        G  
Where he got the bread to go   
      F            Am  
there ain't nobody knows  

:chorus  

C  
Poets tell how Pancho fell   
G  
and Lefty's living in a cheap hotel  
F  
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold   
    C            G  
And so the story ends we're told  
F                           
Pancho needs your prayers it's true   
C                  F  
but save a few for Lefty too  
Am                  F      G  
He only did what he had to do    
    F                Am  
and now he's growing old
