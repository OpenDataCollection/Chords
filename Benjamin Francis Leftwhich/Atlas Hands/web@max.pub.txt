capo 4


Bm              D               G
Take me to the docks, there's a ship without a name that
Bm              D               G
It is sailing to the middle of the sea
Bm              D               G
The water there is deeper than anything you've ever seen
Bm              D               G
Jump right in and swim until you freeze

Em      G       D       A
I will remember your face
Em      G       D       A
'Cause I am still in love with that place
Em      G       D       A
But when the stars are the only things we share
Em      G       D       A
Will you be there?

Bm              D               G
Money came like rain to your hands while you were waiting
Bm              D               G
For that cold long promise to appear
Bm              D               G
People in the churches started singing above their hands
Bm              D               G
They say "My God is a good God and he cares"

Em      G       D       A
I will remember your face
Em      G       D       A
'Cause I am still in love with that place
Em      G       D       A
When the stars are the only things we share
Em      G       D       A
Will you be there?

Em      G
I've got a plan
D       A
I've got an atlas in my hands
Em      G       D       A
I'm gonna turn when I listen to the lessons that I've learned

Em      G
I've got a plan
D       A
I've got an atlas in my hands
Em      G       D       A
I'm gonna turn when I listen to the lessons that I've learned
