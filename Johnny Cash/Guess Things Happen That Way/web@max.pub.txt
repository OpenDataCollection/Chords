capo 1

          A                 D          A
Well  you ask me if I ll forget my baby
A              D
I guess I will some day
A                     E                        A   E 
I don t like it but I guess things happen that way

    A              D          A
You ask me if I ll get along
A              D
I guess I will some way
A                     E                        A   E 
I don t like it but I guess things happen that way

D                A                
God gave me that girl to lean on  
E              A         D
then he put me on my own
D              A            
Heaven help me be a man and 
E                    A
have the strength to stand alone
A                     E                        A    E 
I don t like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I ll miss her kisses
I guess I will every day
I don t like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I ll find another
I don t know  I can t say
I don t like it but I guess things happen that way
