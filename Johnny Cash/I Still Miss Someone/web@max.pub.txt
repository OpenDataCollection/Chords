capo 1

      A        D          E
At my door the leaves are falling
  D          E         A
A cold, wild wind will come
A                D     E
Sweethearts walk by together
    D       E        A
And I still miss someone

  A      D       E
I go out on a party
    D          A      E
And look for a little fun
      A       D          E
But I find a darkened corner
      D       E        A
Cause I still miss someone

      D         E          A
No, I never got over those blue eyes
  D   E         A
I see them everywhere
  D          E         A
I miss those arms that held me
     D       E        A
When all the love was there
