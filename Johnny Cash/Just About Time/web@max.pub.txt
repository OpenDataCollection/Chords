Having a hard time feeling blue trying to get over you
                                          G7               C
Maybe it's just about time I told you I'm all through with you
                                            G7              C
But just about the time I start to tell you I start feeling blue
    F                                   C
And just about then I lose my nerve and wait another day or two
                                            G7              C
Cause just about the time I think it's over I start missing you

Hardest thing I'll ever do trying to get over you

It's just about time I had my saying I told you a thing or two
                                         G7                   C
It's just about time I paid you back for treating me like you do
    F                                     C
But just about the time I get the nerve I can't seem to carry through
                                       G7                C
Cause just about then an empty feeling reminds me I miss you
F       C    G7       C      F       C    G7       C
Like to find somebody new if I could just get over you

It's just about time I let you know I've had my fill of you

But just about the time I think about going I start missing you
    F                            C
I'd like to go find another love that'll never be untrue

But just about the time I think about leaving I start missing you
