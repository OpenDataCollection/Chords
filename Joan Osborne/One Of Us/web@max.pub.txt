   Em        C     G             D
If God had a name  what would it be 
              Em             C        
And would you call it to his face  
G           D 
if you were faced with him 
   Em      C      G              D
In all his glory  what would you ask 
           Em       G
if you had just one question 

C           G      D
Yeah  yeah  God is great 
C           G      D
Yeah  yeah  God is good
C           D       
Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah

        Em      C      G   D
What if God was one of us 
       Em        C      G   D
Just a slob like one of us 
       Em       C      G             D            Em   C  G  D
Just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home

   Em        C     G             D
If God had a face  what would it look like 
          Em          C    
And would you want to see 
G         D                    Em        C   
if seeing meant that you would have to believe  
   G           D             Em            C          G       D
in things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints and all the prophets
