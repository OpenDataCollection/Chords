  G           D            Em                C
As the winter winds litter London with lonely hearts
  G           D            Em                 C
Oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
  G             D                 Em                    C
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
    G       D       Em               C
For every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt

C                G
And my head told my heart
C      G    D
"Let love grow"
C               G
But my heart told my head
C      G    D
"This time no this time no"

 G             D            Em         C
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
 G            D            EM                 C
And the time we were given will be left for the world
 G             D             Em                C
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
 G              D             Em            C
So let the memories be good for those who stay


C                 G
And my head told my heart
 C     G    D
"Let love grow"     
C                G
But my heart told my head
 C     G    D
"This time no"
C                G
Yes, my heart told my head
  C     G   D
"This time no
This time no"


       G               D                Em              C
Oh the shame that sent me off from the God that I once loved
      G             D                 Em
Was the same that sent me into your arms
      G               D               Em             C
Oh and pestilence is won when you are lost and I am gone
    G          D           Em
And no hope, no hope will overcome

    G          D          Em         C
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
    G         D          Em      C
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
    G         D          Em       C
You'll be happy and wholesome again
    G          D         Em       C
When the city clears and sun ascends




C                G
And my head told my heart
  C    G    D
"Let love grow"
C                G
But my heart told my head
  C     G   D
"This time no"
 C                G
And my head told my heart
  C    G    D
"Let love grow"
C                   G
But my heart told my head
  C    G    D
"This time no

This time no"
