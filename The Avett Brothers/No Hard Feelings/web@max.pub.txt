[Intro]

C  Em  Am  F  Em  F  G

After every G do the usual Avett walk up to the C or F for the next chord. Enjoy!


[Verse]

C                  Em        Am
When my body won't hold me anymore 
F              Em
And it finally lets me free 
F         G
Will I be ready? 
C                  Em           Am
When my feet won't walk another mile 
F                           Em
And my lips give their last kiss goodbye 
F                G
Will my hands be steady?


[Chorus]

       F
When I lay down my fears 
   G
My hopes and my doubts 
    F
The rings on my fingers
        G 
And the keys to my house
    Am  E    F         G 
With no hard feelings


[Verse]

C                  Em         Am
When the sun hangs low in the west 
F                         Em
And the light in my chest won't be kept 
F               G
Held at bay any longer 
C                 Em    Am
When the jealousy fades away
F                     Em
And it's ash and dust for cash and lust 
F             G
And it's just hallelujah 


[Chorus]

    F
And love in thoughts 
    G
And love in the words 
F
Love in the songs 
     G
they sing in the church 
   Am  E   F          
And no hard feelings


[Bridge]

G                    C       F
Lord they knows they haven't done 
G             C   F
Much good for anyone 
G       C          F
Kept me afraid and cold 
G               C        F      G7
With so much to have and hold


[Verse]

C                  Em      Am
When my body won't hold me anymore 
F              Em
And it finally lets me free 
F            G
Where will I go? 
C                    Em      Am
Will the trade winds take me south 
F                        Em
Through Georgia grain or tropical rain 
F                G
Or snow from the heavens?


C                    Em    Am
Will I join with the ocean blue
F               Em 
Or run into the savior true 
F               G
And shake hands laughing 


[Chorus]

    F
And walk through the night 
G
Straight to the light 
F
Holding the love 
G
I've known in my life 
   Am  E   F  
And no hard feelings


[Outro]

G                    C       F
Lord they knows they haven't done 
G             C   F
Much good for anyone 
G       C          F
Kept me afraid and cold
G               C        F 
With so much to have and hold 
G         C       F
Under the curving sky 
G           C        F
I'm finally learning why 
G              C      F
It matters for me and you 
G             C       F
To say it and mean it too 
G                C     F
For life and its loveliness 
G              C   F
And all of its ugliness 
G           C       F
Good as its been to me
G         C  F 
I have no enemies 
G         C  F 
I have no enemies
G         C  F 
I have no enemies
G         C  F 
I have no enemies
