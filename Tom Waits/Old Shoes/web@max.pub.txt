    G                     C           G 
I'm singing this song its time it was sung
                            D 
I been putting it off for a while
        G         C             G           C     
But its harder by now cause the truth is so clear 
       G            D          G     D
that I cry when I'm seeing you smile

       G      C        G             C
So goodbye so long the road calls me dear 
         G                       D
And your tears cannot bind me anymore 
        G           C             G          C 
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
      G            D            G       D
And I kiss you and then I'll be gone 

     G                  C             G    
Everytime that I try to tell you that we've 
                                  D
lost the magic that we had at the start 
        G       C            G            C
I would weep my heart when I look in your eyes 
      G            D            G       D
And I search once again for the spark

chorus

      G                    C           G
I can see by your eyes its time now to go 
                                D
so I'll leave you to cry in the rain 
         G          C        G          C
though I held in my hand the key to all joy 
             G             D          G       D
but honey my heart was not born to be tamed

chorus
