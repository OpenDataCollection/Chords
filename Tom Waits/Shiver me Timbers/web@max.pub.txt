capo 2

E              A
I'm leaving my family
E              C#m
leaving all my friends
E            F#
my body's at home
       F#m       B   E
but my hearts in the wind
          E               A
where the clouds are like headlines
     E             C#m 
on a new frontpage sky
   E              F#
my tears are salt water
        F#m        B   E
and the moons full and high

And I know Martin Eden's
gonna be proud of me
many before me
has been drawn by the sea
To be up in the crow's nest 
singing my say
Shiver me Timbers
as I'm sailing away


Ebm    
Now the fog's lifting 
         C      
and the sand's shifting
     E           F#
I'm drifting on out

Old captain Ahab
              B          
he ain't got nothing on me

So swallow me , follow me
I'm travelling alone
Blue waters my daughter
I'm gonna skip like a stone

so please call my misses
tell her not to cry
'cause my googbye is written
by the moon in the sky
Nobody knows me
I can't fathom my stayin'
shiver me timbers
as I'm sailing away

Now the fogs liftin'......


I'm leaving my family
leaving all my friends
my body's at home 
but my hearts in the wind
where the clouds are like headlines
on a new frontpage sky
shiver me timbers
as I'm sailing  goodbye
