C            F
Mocking bird high in a tree
C                      F
Looks like you got the best of me
C            F
Mocking bird singing his song
C
Well the mocking bird mocking me
F
Now that you're gone


G7  Am   F  C
whistle whistle 


Mocking bird high in loof
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof
Well mocking bird singing his song
Well the mocking bird mocking me
Now that you're gone

Well mocking bird high in a tree
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me
And mocking bird high in loof
Blowing notes on top of my roof

Mocking bird high in tree
Well looking up at you, looking down at me
And mocking bird singing his song
Well the mocking bird mocking me
Now that you're gone

Throwed some papers, tried to scare him away
Just looked down at me and this is what he said

And the mocking bird high in a tree
Looks like you got the best of me
Mocking bird singing his song
Well the mocking bird mocking me
Now that you're gone
