G    Am    C       D
Blue skies over my head
G               Am        C          D     
Give me another reason to get out of bed
    G    Am    C           D
And blue skies shine on my face
Em        D     C     B  Am    D    G
Give me another woman to take  her  place

G            Am     C             D
Ain't got no money, cupboards are bare
G                     Am       C          D     
No cigarettes and the kids got nothing to wear
    G      Am      C     D
She walked out without a word
        Em   D     C    B      A  D    G
Now the only sound left is the morning bird singing

G    Am    C       D
Blue skies over my head
G               Am        C          D     
Give me another reason to get out of bed
    G    Am    C           D
And blue skies shine on my face
Em        D     C     B  Am    D    G
Give me another woman to take  her  place
Em        D     C     B  Am    D    G
Give me another woman to take  her  place
